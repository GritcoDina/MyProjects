    <!-- About -->
    <h2>About the Yorkshire Terrier</h2>
    <p>The <b>Yorkshire Terrier</b> is a <b>small</b> dog breed of terrier type, developed during the 19th century in
        Yorkshire, England. Ideally its maximum size is 3.2 kg. A popular companion dog, the <b>Yorkshire Terrier</b>
        has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the <i> Silky Terrier.</i> It has a grey,
        black and tan coat, and the breed's nickname is <big>Yorkie</big>.
    </p>

    <!-- Care -->
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nutrition <br>
            The Yorkshire Terrier should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or
            home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s
            age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s calorie
            consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause
            obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have
            any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Grooming <br>
            The Yorkshire Terrier’s coat is very similar to human hair and should be treated accordingly. If the coat is
            kept long, it needs to be brushed daily. To avoid eye irritation, the hair on the upper part of the head
            should be trimmed short or pulled up into a topknot. The Yorkie will need a bath every week or so. Check the
            ears weekly for any debris or signs of infection. The breed’s national parent club, the Yorkshire Terrier
            Club of America, provides detailed grooming and bathing instructions on its website.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Exercise <br>
            Even small dogs require exercise to stay healthy, both mentally and physically. Yorkies will benefit from
            both moderate exercise, such as walks with their owner at a steady pace, as well as occasional short bursts
            of activity, such as chasing after a tennis ball in the backyard. A short walk twice a day will likely be
            enough for your Yorkie to see new scenery and burn off energy. Participating in dog sports such as obedience
            or agility also will provide beneficial activity to keep him healthy, while challenging his mind as well.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Training <br>
            Yorkies love their owners, and are very intelligent and eager to please. Offering effusive praise and treats
            for good behavior will work far better with the Yorkie than harsh corrections. Starting from an early age,
            the Yorkie should be socialized to strange situations, people, and other dogs. Take him into new situations
            slowly, and always in a calm and happy atmosphere. These should be positive experiences. Despite their small
            size, Yorkies can participate in and excel at canine activities such as rally, agility and obedience, and
            many Yorkies serve with their human partners in roles such as therapy work.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Health <br>
            Yorkshire Terriers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health
            conditions such as eye anomalies and luxating patella, a dislocated kneecap once called a “trick knee” in
            humans. To help avoid the latter, care should be taken to limit the Yorkie’s jumping height, especially as a
            puppy.
