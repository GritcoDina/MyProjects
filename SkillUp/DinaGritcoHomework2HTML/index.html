            <h2>About the Yorkshire Terrier</h2>
            <p>The <b>Yorkshire Terrier</b> is a <b>small</b> dog breed of terrier type, developed during the 19th
                century in
                Yorkshire, England. Ideally its maximum size is 3.2 kg. A popular companion dog, the <b>Yorkshire
                    Terrier</b>
                has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the <i> Silky Terrier.</i> It has a grey,
                black and tan coat, and the breed's nickname is <big>Yorkie</big>.

                <li class="allcare"> <span> Nutrition</span> <br>
                    The Yorkshire Terrier should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured
                    or
                    home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to
                    the
                    dog’s
                    age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s
                    calorie
                    consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can
                    cause
                    obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if
                    you
                    have
                    any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.

                <li class="allcare"> <span>Grooming</span><br>
                    The Yorkshire Terrier’s coat is very similar to human hair and should be treated accordingly. If the
                    coat is
                    kept long, it needs to be brushed daily. To avoid eye irritation, the hair on the upper part of the
                    head
                    should be trimmed short or pulled up into a topknot. The Yorkie will need a bath every week or so.
                    Check
                    the
                    ears weekly for any debris or signs of infection. The breed’s national parent club, the Yorkshire
                    Terrier
                    Club of America, provides detailed grooming and bathing instructions on its website.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="allcare"> <span>Exercise</span> <br>
                    Even small dogs require exercise to stay healthy, both mentally and physically. Yorkies will benefit
                    from
                    both moderate exercise, such as walks with their owner at a steady pace, as well as occasional short
                    bursts
                    of activity, such as chasing after a tennis ball in the backyard. A short walk twice a day will
                    likely
                    be
                    enough for your Yorkie to see new scenery and burn off energy. Participating in dog sports such as
                    obedience
                    or agility also will provide beneficial activity to keep him healthy, while challenging his mind as
                    well.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="allcare"> <span>Training</span> <br>
                    Yorkies love their owners, and are very intelligent and eager to please. Offering effusive praise
                    and
                    treats
                    for good behavior will work far better with the Yorkie than harsh corrections. Starting from an
                    early
                    age,
                    the Yorkie should be socialized to strange situations, people, and other dogs. Take him into new
                    situations
                    slowly, and always in a calm and happy atmosphere. These should be positive experiences. Despite
                    their
                    small
                    size, Yorkies can participate in and excel at canine activities such as rally, agility and
                    obedience,
                    and
                    many Yorkies serve with their human partners in roles such as therapy work.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="allcare"> <span>Health</span> <br>
                    Yorkshire Terriers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for
                    health
                    conditions such as eye anomalies and luxating patella, a dislocated kneecap once called a “trick
                    knee”
                    in
                    humans. To help avoid the latter, care should be taken to limit the Yorkie’s jumping height,
                    especially
                    as a
                    puppy.
